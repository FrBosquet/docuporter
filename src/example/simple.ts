// We are goin to make a report on an algorithm that takes three indiviuals with their ages, and a salary table. We are going to determine how much money each of them makes, and how much they make together.

// You can run this example by running `npm run example:simple` and check the result in `src/example/simple.md`

import { DocuPorter } from "..";

import path from 'path';

const fileNameWithoutExt = path.basename(__filename, path.extname(__filename));
const mdPath = path.join('src/example', `${fileNameWithoutExt}.md`);

// We need to instantiate a DocuPorter object with the path to the markdown file where we want to write the report
const rep = new DocuPorter(mdPath);

// We can now start writing the report by adding a title
rep.h1('Example 1: Salary Report');

// These are the people we are going to use in our example
const people = [

// We want to explain all this in the report, so we start by adding pararaphs and json blocks to the md to explan what we are doing
rep.text('We have three people:');
rep.json(people);

rep.text('And we have a table with the salaries each person earns when it reaches an specific age:');
rep.json(salaries);

// We can now start doing the calculations we need to do to get the results we want. We are going to use the map function to get the salaries for each person. We can add a code clause to the report to explain what we are doing

const peopleWithSalaries = people.map(person => {
  let salary = 0;

// When traversing a list of object, we may want to report only one item to make an example. We can use the reporter conditions and values to do that. In this case, we only want to mkae reporting for the second person in the list, so we set the condition name to be Jane. Now we can set the value of name to be each of the name of the report, and only when the name matches the condition, the report will take place
rep.setCondition('name', 'Jane');

rep.text('We can now sum all the salaries to get the total amount of money they make together using a reduce function:');
rep.ts(`const totalSalaries = peopleWithSalaries.reduce((acc, person) => acc + person.salary, 0);`);

const totalSalaries = peopleWithSalaries.reduce((acc, person) => {

  // To debug code, you can also use the rep.log function to print to the console. It does the same as console.log, but it only does if the conditions and values match
  rep.log('When the name is', person.name, 'the accumulator is', acc); // This will only print when the name is Jane. This can be pretty handy to debug large arrays mapping or reducing

  return acc + person.salary

// Once we are done with the calculation loop, we can clear up the conditions and values so they don't affect the rest of the report
rep.clearConditions();
